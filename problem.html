    		<p><b>Problem</b> &mdash; is that such things as Monitoring, Analytics and Logging are always invisible for end-users, and this invisibility naturally puts such tasks on the background, into the backlog, for later. And if it happens it has negative impact on the Product UX/CX/PX because Software Development Teams loose important feedback loops.</p>

    		<p>This is super natural for the Development Teams to concentrate on their Products and this is super natural not to have resources for non-user facing tasks. We absolutely understand this! And that's why we are here. We are here to help Teams with their Product Analytics tasks.</p>

    		<p>There are <a href="comparison.html#marketing" data-dtu>Analytics tools for Marketing</a>, there are <a href="comparison.html#product" data-dtu>Analytics tools for Product</a>. We made an app for Product Analytics. This app is simple to setup and easy to use. It costs nothing in terms of time, money and efforts to setup and it provides Teams with clear visual data-driven feedback from Product UX/CX/PX perspective.</p>

    		<div class="gap-2 col center">
	  			<a class="btn btn-lg col btn-primary center" href="src/dtu_app/index.html" data-dtu>Try how it works right now</a>
        	<p class="no-registration" style="margin-top: 10px">no registration required</p>
				</div>

    		<!--p>Check out <a href="comparison.html">what's the difference between Product Analytics for Marketing and Product Analytics for Product</a> and </p>

    		<p>If the Team didn't put a button on the web-page &mdash; it is visible. But if the Team didn't attach Analytics to the web-page &mdash; it's not. More than that: even if the Team attached Analytics to the web-page &mdash; it's still not visible from the interface, from the end-user point of view.</p>

    			When Teams work on enabling Monitoring, attaching Analytics, Testing the app or improving Logging, then both end-users and stakeholders don't see any changes. 

    		End-users see and use: pages, screens, forms, buttons, links, etc. &mdash; this is the Product. But Monitoring, Analytics and Logging are not the Product. They are supporting services for the Product. And that's why they tend to get into Backlog with a high probability to be done never or late.</p>

    			It looks like nothing changes for the apps and services when we work on making Monitoring, attaching Analytics, improving Logging for them. We want to build the Product and do not waste our resources on such secondary things that are invisible for end-users.
    		If a button is displayed on the page or the app screen &mdash; it is visible, we can see it. If the same page or app screen has no Monitoring, Analytics, Logging &mdash; it is not visible from end-user point of view. Yet it has impact.</p>

    			too many Software Development teams don't know what features, elements and options their users use in their digital Products. They don't make efforts to know that due to <a href="#number_of_reasons">a number of reasons</a>. They add features, elements and options to their apps and services and they have no clue if their users actually using them. They work for output, not outcome.</p>

				<p>This lack of usage information leads teams to <b>another problems</b>: 
					<ul>
						<li>to <a href="https://youtu.be/oazvsSsB4bk?t=810" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dtu>User eXperience rot</a> in their digital Products;</li>
						<li>to a huge waste of time and money on designing, planning, development, testing and delivery of changes to their digital Products.</li>
					</ul>
				</p>

				<p>And everyone suffer as a result:
					<ul>
						<li>Users/clients/players suffer because new elements, features, options add more complexity to the apps and this complexity completely destroys the UX/CX/PX;</li>
						<li>Teams and companies waste their time, money and energy flying blind by adding, testing, supporting staff (that is often not being used by any of their users).</li>
					</ul>
				</p>

				<p><b>One of Solutions</b> here &mdash; is to instrument apps and services with Product Ananlytics (as a part of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_intelligence" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Product Intelligence</a> efforts). And this Product Analytics includes not only Marketing analytics tools (like Google Analytics and similar) but more importantly &mdash; Product analytics tools.</p>

				<h2>What's happen today, in 2023</h2>
				<p>Practice shows [<a href="https://youtu.be/oazvsSsB4bk?t=844" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">1</a>][<a href="https://www.intercom.com/blog/before-you-plan-your-product-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">2</a>][<a href="https://www.intercom.com/blog/videos/be-comfortable-killing-your-features/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">3</a>] that in average only a few product features are being used by the most of customers. And this 19-th century Marketing quote is still true if we don't instrument and use different kinds of analytics in our Products:</p>
				<blockquote class="blockquote text-center">
				  <p class="mb-0"><i>"I am convinced that about one-half the money I spend for advertising is wasted, but I have never been able to figure out which half" [<a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2022/04/11/advertising/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">i</a>]</i></p>
				</blockquote>

				<p>The same problem with uninstrumented Products. Uninstrumented product &mdash; is a huge waste on product design, software development, testing, operations and management processes &mdash; because in this case teams have to guess. And practice shows, that chance of successfull guess in software development is only 10%. That's why we have so many failed startups, products and features that don't fly. Only 1 of 10 features that team (who don't use analytics) builds solves the problem nice way from UX/CX/PX point of view, it is exactly what customer wanted. Other 9 of 10 features are not that good at all.</p>
				<p>This leads to degradation of UX/CX/PX, to experience rot, to higher churn rates, lower upsales, etc. I.e. this waste leads to even more wastes and raises high viability risk for the whole Product and even for a Product company.</p>

					<h2>How companies solve this problem today</h2>

					<div class="col-lg-6">
				<h3>Netflix, Stripe, Spotify and 10-15% of alike Product companies in the world</h3>
				<p>Thanks to processes transparency at GitLab we can take a look <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/product-intelligence-guide/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">how they do Product Intelligence at GitLab</a> today:
					<ul>
						<li>they have a <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">dedicated Product Intelligence team</a>;</li>
						<li>this team uses Google Analytics for Marketing analysis;</li>
						<li>this team <b>develops and supports their self-made tools</b> for front-end (Snowplow) and back-end (Service Ping) analytics for Product analysis.</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>Why do they develop these Product analysis tools (Snowplow and Service Ping) by themselves? Because:
					<ul>
						<li>there are no such tools in the market right now (and there was no 3 years ago when GitLab started) &mdash; that's why today such Product teams need to organize data collection and analysis by themselves;</li>
						<li><a href="https://about.gitlab.com/direction/#vision" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">they want to become #1</a> in their market by 2030 &mdash; and they know that they can't build #1 product in the market without Product Intelligence tooling.</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
					</div>
					<div class="col-lg-6">
				<h3>The rest 85-90% of Product companies in the world</h3>
				<p>Years of observations from Product people show [<a href="https://youtu.be/h-KVGHoQ_98?t=951" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">4</a>][<a href="https://youtu.be/A9wx91rVTms?t=1869" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">5</a>] that only about 10-15% of software development teams make and use tooling both for Product and Marketing analytics. Both make and use. Both Marketing (before purchase) and Product (after purchase) analytics. These teams work in a real Agile software development lifecycle with deployments to production for several times a day or a week &mdash; that's why they need real data feedback to make data-driven decisions for their digital products.</p>
				<p id="number_of_reasons">Teams who don't apply tooling, they don't do it because of the number of reasons:
					<ol>
						<li><b>Ignorance.</b> Management knows "what features to build", "what customers and users want" &mdash; so they don't feel that they need to be data-driven and that's why they don't use these tools;</li>
						<li><b>No experience.</b> Practice shows [<a href="https://youtu.be/h-KVGHoQ_98?t=951" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">6</a>] that 85% of teams in the world don't work in true Agile software development lifecycle (they work in a "waterfall" model even if they have "Agile rituals" and call themselves "Agile") &mdash; and they just don't know how to be data-driven and how it works, because they have never been working this way;</li>
						<li><b>No resources.</b> Development and usage of analytics tools looks like a side-project. Teams have their Products to build and they do not have resources of time and people to implement their own tooling. And due to #1 and #2 reasons managers don't ask them to solve this "we have no data" problem;</li>
						<li><b>Sales-driven.</b> What <a href="https://youtu.be/TRZAJY23xio?t=1542" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Steve Jobs mentioned in his interview in 1995</a> is still true: product-driven startups grow and they become marketing-driven and sales-driven companies. From Product companies they become Process companies. And such companies are not a place to work for the talanted Product people &mdash; so they leave these companies and companies loose those sense and skills of Product development.</li>
