	  		<h2>Do They Use vs. Google Analytics and alike tools</h2>
	  		<p><b>Do They Use</b> and <b>Google Analytics</b> apps are not competitors. They work together. For example, this website has both Google Analytics and Do They Use apps enabled. These apps are for different purposes.</p>

	  		<p><b>Google Analytics</b>-alike tools (<a href="https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dtu>Google Analytics</a>, <a href="https://www.heap.io" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dtu>Heap.io</a>, <a href="https://mixpanel.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dtu>Mixpanel</a>, <a href="https://amplitude.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dtu>Amplitude</a>, <a href="https://www.smartlook.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dtu>Smartlook</a> and similar) help us to convert our visitors to buyers, to customers, to users. Keywords for such tools identification: conversions, cohorts, retention, revenue, funnels, leads, events, aquisition, engagement, monetization, page views, scrolls, sessions, etc. &mdash; this is what these apps focus on.</p>

	  		<p>But once visitors are converted, once they bought our digital product and started using it, there's nothing to convert anymore. Since that moment all we want &mdash; is to increase lifetime value <b>both for and from</b> our customers.</p>

	  		<p>The way we can do this &mdash; is by providing great UX/CX/PX in our apps. And this is where <b>Do They Use</b> app comes in: it helps us to build delightful UX/CX/PX for the customers who already buy from us, who already use our products. It does that by providing development teams with quantitative data analysis for their digital Products. Keywords for such tools identification: elements usage, features usage, users who most / least use this element / feature, users that never use an element / feature, elements that have never been used by specific group of users, element / feature adoption, frequency of use for element / feature, etc.</p>

	  		<p><b>Google Analytics</b>-alike tools are used mainly before the purchase of our app or product and are used much less after the purchase. They optimize for a purchase. <b>Do They Use</b> app is used mostly after purchase of our app or product and much less before the purchase. It optimizes for delight, for upsales, for repetition of purchases. That's why Marketing tools are mostly for "before purchase" (or choose to use) phase, and Product tools are mostly for "after purchase" phase. And that's why the name of the app: <b>Do They Use</b>. All Product tools could have been named "Do They Use?"-tools. While Marketing tools could have been named "Do They Convert?"-tools.</p>

						<h3>Google Analytics &mdash; is for <span class="bg-gold">Marketing</span></h3>
						<p><b>Google Analytics</b> &mdash; is a tool for Marketing and Product Marketing analytics. It helps teams to understand if there any visitors on website, where do they come from (both geographycally and from any referring web resource), how much time do they spend on web site, do they visit links in the menu, do they "convert" and how much, etc. It helps teams to make Product Marketing decisions.</p>

						<p>Google Analytics helps to get answers on the questions like:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Do we have visitors on our website and mobile app?</li>
								<li>If yes, which pages or screens do they visit? And how many times?</li>
								<li>How many visitors?</li>
								<li>How much time do they spend on each page?</li>
								<li>Did they view the page, did they scroll?</li>
								<li>Which page to page paths do they usually navigate?</li>
								<li>Do they "convert" (signup, buy, download, leave a email, etc.)? And how many? What is conversion rate?</li>
								<li>Where do they come from (organic search, advertisements, social networks, etc.)?</li>
								<li>Where do they come from (country, city)?</li>
								<li>What platforms do they use (desktop, tablet, smartphone)?</li>
								<li>What browsers do they use?</li>
								<li>What is their screen resolution size?</li>
								<li>What is about engagement?</li>
								<li>etc.</li>
							</ul>

						<p>This information helps teams to optimize their apps and services for the puproses they were created:
							<ul>
								<li>convert visitors into users / customers / players (buy, download something, leave an emeail, etc.);</li> 
								<li>connect customers with Support / Sales / HR;</li>
								<li>provide visitors with open job positions;</li>
								<li>provide visitors with more information about the company.</li>
							</ul>
						</p>

						<h3>Do They Use &mdash; is for <span class="bg-gold">Product</span></h3>

						<p><b>Do They Use</b> &mdash; is an app for Product Management and Product Development. It helps teams make product decisions to do what matters from Product and UX/CX/PX points of view. Do They Use helps teams to get answers on questions "what to develop next and why" based on their app real usage data.</p>
						
						<p><b>Do They Use</b> app helps to get answers on the questions like:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Do they use all webpage or app elements?</li>
							<li>Which elements do they use most often?</li>
							<li>Which elements they never use?</li>
							<li>Which elements do most of the users use? Which ones are barely used by anyone?</li>
							<li>What options do they choose most often? Which ones they never choose?</li>
							<li>Does our new feature or web element gets traction? How it goes live?</li>
							<li>What elements need our attention (because of too high or too low usage)?</li>
							<li>What elements started to have anomaly of usage: too high or too low usage? Maybe we released some bug and now we have such anomaly there?</li>
							<li>Who of them actually uses this? Are they real buying customers or they are just free trial users, leads, your employees or simply visitors?</li>
							<li>etc.</li>
						</ul>

						<p>Development teams get the insights on what could be improved in the app based on real usage data that helps to grow the business as well. They don't just optimize. They optimize for the categories of customers they see really use the app. It helps to understand if users use all the elements on each screen of the app, how much do they use and who of them namely. It helps to understand which options (radio, checkbox, dropdown list, file, range, etc.) are selected the most, which controls are most popular and which not.</p>

						<p>This information helps teams to get rid of elements and options that never being used and to focus optimization of UX/CX/PX for the different kinds of users and users groups to grow the business:
							<ul>
								<li>already buing customers;</li>
								<li>free users who eventually convert to buying customers;</li>
								<li>free users who never convert to buying customers, but who ambasador and advocate for the app and help to bring more new buying customers.</li>
							</ul>

				<p>So, Product Analytics could be done differently, but in general there are two major domains there: <span class="bg-gold">Marketing</span> and <span class="bg-gold">Product</span>.

  				<p>As an example here I've chosen BrawlStars game (made by Finnish company Supercell) because we play it with my 9-year old niece. This is a multiplayer online battle arena and third-person hero shooter video game which is available both for iOS and Android.</p>

  				<p>Released worldwide on December 12, 2018, the game was nominated for "Mobile Game" and "EE Mobile Game of the Year" at the 15th British Academy Games Awards.</p>

  				<p>In 2020, Brawl Stars had the second highest gross of any mobile game in Europe. It grossed $526M in total in 2020, which accounted for more than half its life time revenue. It was also the fourth game by Supercell to surpass $1B in lifetime revenue.
