				<p>Product Analytics could be done differently. But in general there are two major domains there: <span class="bg-gold">Marketing</span> and <span class="bg-gold">Product</span>. In this article we show you case studies both for Marketing and Product in different software development branches:

	  				<h2>Marketing: Google Analytics app</h2>

	  				<p><b>Google Analytics</b> app helps to understand if there any visitors on website, where do they come from (both geographycally and from any referring web resource), how much time do they spend on web site, do they visit links in the menu, do they "convert" and how much.</p>
												
						<p>This information helps development teams to optimize this web site for the puproses it was created:
							<ul>
								<li>convert visitors into users / customers / players;</li> 
								<li>connect customers with Support / Sales / HR;</li>
								<li>provide visitors with open job positions;</li>
								<li>provide visitors with more information about the company.</li>
							</ul>
						</p>
					</div>

					<div class="col-lg">
	  				<h2>Product: Do They Use app</h2>

	  				<p><b>Do They Use</b> app helps to understand if users use all the elements on each screen of the app, how much do they use and who of them namely. It helps to understand which options (radio, checkbox, dropdown list, file, range, etc.) are selected the most, which controls are most popular and which not.</p>
												
						<p>This information helps development teams to get rid of elements and options that never being used and to focus optimization of UX/CX/PX for the different kinds of users and users groups to grow the business:
							<ul>
								<li>already buing customers;</li>
								<li>free users who eventually convert to buying customers;</li>
								<li>free users who never convert to buying customers, but who ambasador and advocate for the app and help to bring more new buying customers.</li>
							</ul>
						</p>

						<p>Development teams get the insights on what could be improved in the app based on real usage data that helps to grow the business as well. They don't just optimize. They optimize for the categories of customers they see really use the app.</p>

  				<p>As an example here I've chosen BrawlStars game (made by Finnish company Supercell) because we play it with my 9-year old niece. This is a multiplayer online battle arena and third-person hero shooter video game which is available both for iOS and Android.</p>

  				<p>Released worldwide on December 12, 2018, the game was nominated for "Mobile Game" and "EE Mobile Game of the Year" at the 15th British Academy Games Awards.</p>

  				<p>In 2020, Brawl Stars had the second highest gross of any mobile game in Europe. It grossed $526M in total in 2020, which accounted for more than half its life time revenue. It was also the fourth game by Supercell to surpass $1B in lifetime revenue.
