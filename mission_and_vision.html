    		<h2>World of more Intelligent Digital Products with better Connection between Software Development teams and their Product Consumers</h2>

        <h3>Outcome, not output -driven world</h3>
        <p>Imagine a world where Software Development teams do only meaningful jobs while making their Products. They know why they build a thing (either a button or a feature or even a service) into their Product and how this thing will benefit both their customers and business of their company. They know this because they've obtained an evidence that this solution will work the way they expect before they delivered it to their customers. And when they made a delivery, they see how the thing realy worked, did they get the results, did they solve the problem for the customers.</p>

        <h3>Data beats opinions -driven world</h3>
        <p>Imagine a world where no more "blue or light-blue" opinions discussions meetings. Instead, "how can we measure an impact of this idea and compare results with our OKRs?" discussions meetings. No more: "boss wants this", "we think it will not work", "we hope this will work better", but instead: "data shows us, that this solution will not allow us to reach our OKRs for this problem, so let's make another experiment".</p>

        <h3>Product Intelligence -driven world</h3>
        <p>Imagine a world where every single entrepreneur, every team, every company in the world could get a ready-to-go Product Analytics solution, connect it in minutes and with minimum efforts to their apps and bring more Product Intelligence into their Products. Neither dedicated department, nor special qualification, nor high budgets are required for that task anymore. Instead, concentrate solely on building your Product. Product Analytics will be collected for you.</p>

        <h3>Better connected world</h3>
        <p>We believe that the best solutions come out of deep, meaningful connections. Connections between producer and consumer, between team mates, between companies, friends and people in general.</p>

        <p>As one of such connections that desperate for attention we see Product usage feedback. Not so much a Marketing part of Product Analytics, but a Product part, UX/CX/PX part. Answers on questions like: <b>Do they use</b> our app controls? <b>Do they use</b> our app features? And if they do, then how much and how <b>do they use</b> them? And who of them? So we could ask why <b>do they use</b> them and optimize UX/CX/PX for them based on real usage data, based on this feedback, based on this real connection.</p>

        <p>There are lots of Marketing analysis tools in Product Analytics Tools market right now. But we don't see any Product analysis tools. And at the same time we see, that the best Product companies (Stripe, Spotify, Slack, Netflix, Apple, Basecamp, Airbnb, GitHub, etc.) develop their own tools to solve this Product Intelligence problem (take a look <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/product-intelligence-guide/#instrumenting-metrics-and-events" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dtu>how they do it in GitLab</a> for example).</p>

        <p>I.e. the problem exists, but companies solve it with dedicated teams and self-made tools. And if you have no resources for building feedback system for yourself then you fated to fly blind. And with high probability to fail.</p>

        <p>That's why we decided to make <b>Do They Use</b> app. We want more Products to succeed. This world deserves much more Products with great User eXperience, Customer eXperience and Player eXperience.</p>

        <p>So, if you haven't tried it yet, you can:</p>
